The typical breakeven for a collector’s truck is ~$750 (based on 40km roundtrip in Colombo including collection labor). Currently, for feasible collection requires a minimum load of 500kg of plastics (or ~25,000 PET bottles). 

This level of infrastructure costs is difficult for us to bare, so we are currently we are examining partnering with collectors/recyclers who will pitch our platform to. The offering is a careful balance of supply/demand, volume growth and operating costs – essentially a sacrifice of 10-25% of recycler receivables as redemptions to the users, drives volume growth, too little and it won’t incentivize enough to grow user base, too much and the collector can’t cover the operating costs.

We are not taking a cut of the profit until volume growth is proven by our platform (which will then be negotiable).
