Who are we? 
We are a seed stage startup building a scalable, data driven, incentivized recycling platform to cater to emerging markets (EM). Our platform will leverage 1. mobile apps for users, 2. mobile apps for validators, and a 3. dashboard for accessing the data driven insights.

We provide the technology platform that enables EM collection authorities to efficiently collect, direct and understand recyclables. Our platform uses an incentivizing and gamification to attract and grow the users base, attribution to identify user disposal patterns, and educate the users. The gathered data will be used in the form of a dashboard also provide to the collectors for optimizing sorting costs, route optimization, and awareness raising campaigns.
