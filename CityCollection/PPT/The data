# Who are we?

We are a seed stage startup showcasing a proprietary platform to disrupt recycling in emerging markets. Our plan is to use the connectivity provided by increasing smartphone penetration, to drive incentive driven collection


- 150LKR /month is enough to engage responsible recycling!
- Custom dashboard and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms that learns/predicts user disposal patterns
- Directing logistics and connecting recyclers in the most efficient manner and connecting the main recyclers


How does our platform work?

- Recycling efficiency facilitator, that allows for mapping of individual contributions
- Enabling incentive driven recycling through QR code ID
- Data analytics enables more efficient recycling, and targeted education 


Why care?

- Unparalleled control of logistics
- Efficient and rapid user base growth, driving economies of scale
- Education of public (further drive growth)
- Cutting edge data analytics 

How do we implement it?

- Individual bags collected by users
- Each bag has unique QR code ID

- Truck collects bag
- Route optimization enabled

1. At recycler, the bags, QR code gets input
OR
2. Validation at household itself
