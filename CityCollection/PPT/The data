# How do we implement it?

- Individual bags collected by users
- Each bag has unique QR code ID

- Truck collects bag
- Route optimization enabled

1. At recycler, the bags, QR code gets input
OR
2. Validation at household itself

# Problems to overcome?

Implementation Changes 

Option 1: Validation @ recycler 
Recycler validates by counting items in ID garbage bag during sorting
Manually enter respective quantity into app after QR code recognizes bag’s ID (mapped to each user)

Option 2: Validation @ household (by collector)
Collector must validate by counting items for recycling in ID garbage bag
Manually enter respective quantity into app after QR code recognizes bag’s ID (mapped to each user)

Benefits

Scalable (mobile devices/apps to be given to sorters at plant)
Immune from bribery   

Validation happens at collection, not sorting

Need some sort of negotation payment from recyclers per item

*We will provide the mobile devices free
