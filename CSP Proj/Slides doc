CSP Water Heater - Abstract
Aim: to propose the concept of a cheap, DIY design for a solar water heater
Application: For rural areas, low-capita income, with cold whether
Requirements: Reused satellite dish, foil/wrapping paper, bottle, PVC pipe

CSP Water Heater - Design 
Concentrator - Satellite TV Dish – reused, forms a efficient parabolic concentrator
Storage - Fully transparent bottle
Reciever - PVC pipe, best coated with painted aluminium foil  

CSP Water Heater - Principle
Parabolic dish acts as concentrator
Bottle is heated from the inside – 100% of energy directly transferred to surrounding water from reciever 
Heat losses only from water to surface of bottle, limited by covering bottle with wrapping paper

Test and Results
...
Durability - Aluminium foil/Wrapping paper doesn't wear in the sun due to its high reflexivity index. However, susceptibe to high winds etc.

Further Design? 
CPCs are relevant for solar energy collection because they achieve the highest possible concentration for any acceptance angle

- Include other industrial examples and case studies
