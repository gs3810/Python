CSP Water Heater - Abstract
Aim: to propose the concept of a cheap, DIY design for a solar water heater
Application: For rural areas, low-capita income, with cold whether
Requirements: Reused satellite dish, foil/wrapping paper, bottle, PVC pipe

CSP Water Heater - Design 
Concentrator - Satellite TV Dish – reused, forms a efficient parabolic concentrator
Storage - Fully transparent bottle
Reciever - PVC pipe, best coated with painted aluminium foil  

CSP Water Heater - Principle
Parabolic dish acts as concentrator
Bottle is heated from the inside – 100% of energy directly transferred to surrounding water from reciever 
Heat losses only from water to surface of bottle, limited by covering bottle with wrapping paper
