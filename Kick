1.	How do we maintain and grow the trust of our backers?
Two methods;

-	Maximum-Aftermarket (MA). The campaign stops collecting money when the original fundraising goal is reached. Any backers that want to get in afterwards will have to buy the product once it hits the market. Why would entrepreneurs agree to this design since it seems to limit sales? If the product is genuinely marketable, then restricting sales on a crowdfunding platform means relatively few units would be priced at a discount. So when the product finally hits the public at the full retail price, the entrepreneur stands to make more profits.
-	Platform Escrow with Post-campaign Mandatory Verification (PE-V). Any funds that exceed the campaign’s original goal will be put in escrow until the product is developed successfully. If the product fails to deliver, the money in escrow will be used to refund backers. The platform also must take steps to verify that the product works as promised. To minimize the cost of verification, survey the backers to see what they think of the product. Commission traditional testing, which is costlier, only if backers complain the product didn’t deliver
-	Phased project creation to incentivize product delivery/deter fraud

Other platform specific applications:
Indiegogo	-	Option to choose a fixed funding goal (all-or-nothing like Kickstarter) or a flexible funding goal
-	InDemand lets you continue raising money even after your crowdfunding campaign ends (production stage or getting ready to fulfill orders)
Patreon	-	Choose to let patrons pay “per month” for special community perks, or pay “per Creation” to incentivize you to create more
-	Exclusive perks based on different payment tiers, such as exclusive content, branded swag, sneak peeks, shoutouts, etc

2.	Fee structure?
-	Kickstarter and Indiegogo charge 5% (excl. 3% for credit card)

3.	Features to penetrate market? 
-	Wisdom of the crowd incorporated as another aspect of the platform - Users/potential backers can give their 2 cents on the WIP project (for free). This won’t generate revenue, but is used for the spreading of the popularity

4.	How to spread the word?
-	Going to networking events for word-of-mouth transfer
-	Fund a few very successful campaigns
-	What are the other ways we can reach SL mass market? Has to be truly innovative

5.	Main issues faced by competitor
-	Lack of willingness to display full details of projects
-	Market not mature enough – not sure how much marketing and marketing channels were used
-	Getting IPG was very difficult (1 year; banks were reluctant due to risk)
-	Registered as pvt – wasn’t too much bottlenecked
