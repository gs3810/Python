1.	How do we maintain and grow the trust of our backers?
Two methods;

-	Maximum-Aftermarket (MA). The campaign stops collecting money when the original fundraising goal is reached. Any backers that want to get in afterwards will have to buy the product once it hits the market. Why would entrepreneurs agree to this design since it seems to limit sales? If the product is genuinely marketable, then restricting sales on a crowdfunding platform means relatively few units would be priced at a discount. So when the product finally hits the public at the full retail price, the entrepreneur stands to make more profits.
-	Platform Escrow with Post-campaign Mandatory Verification (PE-V). Any funds that exceed the campaign’s original goal will be put in escrow until the product is developed successfully. If the product fails to deliver, the money in escrow will be used to refund backers. The platform also must take steps to verify that the product works as promised. To minimize the cost of verification, survey the backers to see what they think of the product. Commission traditional testing, which is costlier, only if backers complain the product didn’t deliver
-	Phased project creation to incentivize product delivery/deter fraud

Other platform specific applications:
Indiegogo	-	Option to choose a fixed funding goal (all-or-nothing like Kickstarter) or a flexible funding goal
-	InDemand lets you continue raising money even after your crowdfunding campaign ends (production stage or getting ready to fulfill orders)
Patreon	-	Choose to let patrons pay “per month” for special community perks, or pay “per Creation” to incentivize you to create more
-	Exclusive perks based on different payment tiers, such as exclusive content, branded swag, sneak peeks, shoutouts, etc

2.	Fee structure?
-	Kickstarter and Indiegogo charge 5% (excl. 3% for credit card)

3.	Features to penetrate market? 
-	Wisdom of the crowd incorporated as another aspect of the platform - Users/potential backers can give their 2 cents on the WIP project (for free). This won’t generate revenue, but is used for the spreading of the popularity
  Creative projects like films, books can offer various non-monetary incentives such as special mentions, pre-order options etc
  Creative home projects and budding artists
  
4.	How to spread the word?
-	Going to networking events for word-of-mouth transfer
-	Fund a few very successful campaigns
-	What are the other ways we can reach SL mass market? Has to be truly innovative

5.	Main issues faced by competitor
-	Lack of willingness to display full details of projects
-	Market not mature enough – not sure how much marketing and marketing channels were used
-	Getting IPG was very difficult (1 year; banks were reluctant due to risk)
-	Registered as pvt – wasn’t too much bottlenecked

6 Platform: Should we go with wordpress
Ans: YES, you should go for the WordPress platform to start your Crowdfunding website only if
You are testing waters: If you are new to the crowdfunding niche you want to jump in and not sure how the targetted audience will accept and adopt your platform.
You are targetting small groups: If you are going to target a small group of people with less funding requirements and with the ability to invest a small amount of money.
You are not sure about your plan: If you not sure whether you will take your crowdfunding business seriously and don’t want to spend serious money on it.
Ans: NO, you should not choose the WordPress platform to start your Crowdfunding website if
You are already tested: You are ready to go to your targetted market and already have large userbase.
You want enterprise solution: WordPress is not the right fit if you want to develop an enterprise-level crowdfunding platform to support the large user base and crowdfunding ecosystem.
You are fed up with limitations of WordPress: Yes, I’ve been contacted by many entrepreneurs who have already used WordPress and spent a few hundred dollars buying Crowdfunding WordPress themes and plugins but later realized WordPress is not able to support their ideas, business needs, and customizations.
No doubt, WordPress is a strong and stable platform and technically you can do anything with it. WordPress is a great tool if you want to build a static website for your business with few content pages, landing pages, blog and magazine websites.
However, to build an enterprise-level application with marketplace features like crowdfunding at large scale, WordPress is not a good fit. Software development companies do not rely on WordPress for this kind of solution development but go for strong and secure frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Codeigniter, Laravel and Foundation.
